# FREE Deployment Guide - Demolition Blog Generator

## Option 1: Vercel (RECOMMENDED - 100% FREE)
Vercel is the company that makes Next.js, so it's the best platform for Next.js apps - and it's completely FREE for personal projects!

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to https://github.com/signup
   - Sign up for free

2. **Create a new repository**:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `demolition-blog-generator`
   - Keep it Public (required for free deployment)
   - DON'T initialize with README
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push your code** (copy these commands):
```bash
# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/demolition-blog-generator.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If it asks for credentials:
- Username: your GitHub username
- Password: you need to create a Personal Access Token:
  1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
  2. Generate new token → Select "repo" scope → Generate
  3. Use this token as your password

### Step 2: Deploy on Vercel (FREE)

1. **Go to Vercel**:
   - Visit https://vercel.com
   - Click "Start Deploying"
   - Sign up with GitHub (it's free!)

2. **Import your project**:

   - Value: `https://azdemoexperts.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/c7ffde47-ab0e-42d4-992f-183ea910e4ec`
   
   Add another:

### Step 3: Connect Your Domain (Optional)

If you want to use your GoDaddy domain with Vercel:

1. In Vercel dashboard → Your project → Settings → Domains
2. Add your domain
3. Vercel will give you DNS records
4. In GoDaddy:
   - Go to DNS Management
   - Add the records Vercel provides
   - Usually just changing nameservers or adding A/CNAME records

## Option 2: Netlify (Also FREE)

Another great free option:

1. **Push to GitHub** (same as above)

2. **Deploy on Netlify**:
   - Go to https://netlify.com
   - Sign up with GitHub (free)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose GitHub
   - Select your repository
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Add environment variables (same as Vercel)
   - Deploy!

## Option 3: GitHub Pages (FREE but limited)

GitHub Pages is free but doesn't support server-side features. Since your app uses API routes, this won't work fully, but mentioning it for completeness.

## Quick Command Reference

### First Time Setup:
```bash
# 1. Check you're in the right directory
pwd
# Should show: /Users/amirimouhab/demolition-blog-generator

# 2. Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/demolition-blog-generator.git

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Future Updates:
```bash
# After making changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update description here"
git push

# Vercel will auto-deploy when you push!
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Authentication failed" when pushing to GitHub:**
- You need a Personal Access Token, not your password
- Follow the token creation steps above

**"Repository not found":**
- Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first
- Check the repository name matches exactly

**Vercel deployment failed:**
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure environment variables are set
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

**n8n webhook not working:**

- Test with the `/api/test-webhook` endpoint
